# Contact-less_classroom
The main idea of the project is to create a classroom without contact. So, we will be creating a automated  door, light &amp; sanitization in a class. All together creating a class with no common contact. All are done using Arduino UNO, servo motor, PIR Sens or, Ultra Sound sensor, it â€™s a simple microcontroller  project where we are making , a) Automated door system b) Automated lighting system c) Automated sanitization system
This model is aimed to be implemented in highly crowded areas such as schools and universities.
1)Automatic door opening system:-
The minimum safety distance to avoid the spread of the virus is 6 feet. In our model, we are making 
use of the time taken by the individual to maintain 6 feet distance from other individual.
2)Automatic lightening system:-
This model is constructed mainly to monitor and save the electricity. We may have noticed at certain 
situations where empty rooms will have rotating fans and glowing bulbs. In order to utilize the 
electricity only when there is a need ,this model can be used.
3) Automatic sanitization system:-
This model is constructed to enable a contact free sanitization for students in each room.
In this model, we use ultrasound distance sensor to detect the obstacle this case it is hands and measure the 
distance
